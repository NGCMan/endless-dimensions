This is where you will find everyone who helped with the production of this game and what they did.
-jacobcoder (aka The Incremental Nerd): Dimensions 5-10, the Meta-Shift Button, and a thoughtful production multiplier.
-Reinhardt-C: Did the first remastering of the code.
-TheMKeyHolder: Started the project.
-e666666 (aka Nyan Cat): Added Break_Eternity.js, did the second remastering of the code, and sorted the file system.
This game was originally thought about by the Discord user "why is ng^^ not out," now "ligma has updog." I was originally gonna start the project by copying the code from Hevipelle's tutorial and making production overpowered, but then TheMKeyHolder restarted it from scratch. We hope you like/liked the game.
